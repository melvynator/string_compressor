# Short String Packer

Implement a simple but effective compression scheme for short, simple strings

**Important: Please DO NOT FORK this project to write your solution, because others will be able to see your solution**

## Download
If you have `git` setup and know how to use it, clone (DO NOT FORK) this project to your local machine:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:soumyaray/hw-data_packer.git
```

If you are not familiar with `git`, simply download the RAW version of each file. Click on each filename listed on Github, click the 'RAW' button, and then download that file.

## Overview

In this assignment, you must write the guts of two methods found in the file `short_string_packer.rb`:
- The `pack(str)` method must take a string called `str` and return an Integer
- The `unpack(packed)` method must take an Integer called `packed`, decompress it and return the string that was originally compressed

## Details
Types:
- `str`: A short String that only contains lowercase characters 'a' - 'z' (no spaces, digits, uppercase, symbols, etc.)
- `packed`: An integer of type Integer

Methods:
- `pack(str)`: Realize that the 26 letters 'a'-'z' don't need to use all the bits available in a UTF-8 character. You can use this to compress a string by packing the bits of each character together:
  - take each letter of `str`, convert it to a number from 0-25
  - take the bits of each number have created and *shift* them appropriately, and use a binary operation to pack them together into a single Integer called `packed`
- `unpack(packed)`: Reverse the process above by accepting a packed Integer and returning the reproduced String

## Coding rules
- Do not use any external libraries (gems)
- Do not write code anywhere outside of the two methods of `short_string_packer.rb`
- Do not use any for/while loops. ONLY use `.map`, `.each` and so on.

## Testing
Test your solution by running the test *specification* file:
```
$ ruby packer_spec.rb
```
As you write each method, different tests will pass or fail. Your final solution should see all tests passing:
```
$ ruby packer_spec.rb
